- Code Example

```python
import heapq

INF = int(1e9)
n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]

for _ in range(m):
    a, b, cost = map(int, input().split())
    graph[a].append((b, cost))

def dijkstra(start):
    queue = []
    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start))
    distance = [INF] * (n + 1)
    distance[start] = 0

    while queue:
        dist, now = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if distance[now] < dist:
            continue

        for index, cost in graph[now]:
            new_cost = dist + cost
            if distance[index] > new_cost:
                distance[index] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(q, (new_cost, index))

    return distance
```
